# TraSMAPI-Aimsun

This is a [TraSMAPI](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi) specialisation for [Aimsun simulator](https://www.aimsun.com/).

**TraSMAPI** is a generic API used as bridge for microscopic traffic simulators [(what is a microscopic simulator?)](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi/wiki/Simulation-Models) that allows real-time communication between agents in the urban traffic context (such as vehicles, traffic lights and pedestrians) and the environment created by  various simulators. This tool was developed at LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory), University of Porto.

**Aimsun** is a traffic modelling software that allows you to model anything from a single bus lane to an entire region. With thousands of licensed users in government agencies, consultancies and universities all over the world, Aimsun stands out for the exceptionally high speed of its simulations and for fusing travel demand modelling, static and dynamic traffic assignment with mesoscopic, microscopic and hybrid simulation.
